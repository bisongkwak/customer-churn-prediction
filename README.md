# Predicting Customer Churn with Machine Learning

Welcome to my graduation project repository!  
I'm Bisong Kwak, and this project was part of my thesis for the Computer Engineering program  
at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies (HUFS).

The main goal of this work was to predict which customers are likely to leave (churn)  
and to explore how we can group customers based on their behavior for better retention strategies.

## Project Summary

- Goal: Predict customer churn and suggest group-based retention strategies
- Dataset: Telco Customer Churn Dataset  
  → [Link to Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn)
- Tools: Python, pandas, scikit-learn, seaborn, matplotlib, Jupyter Notebook

## What’s Inside

|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `churn_analysis.ipynb`| Jupyter Notebook with full code (preprocessing, modeling, clustering)       |
| `data_sample.csv`     | Sample dataset (pre-cleaned, anonymized)                                    |
| `feature_importance.png` | Plot showing which features mattered most in predictions                 |
| `cluster_result.png`  | Visual result of customer segmentation using K-Means                        |
| `requirements.txt`    | List of Python libraries used in the project                                |

## Key Takeaways

- TotalCharges, tenure, and MonthlyCharges had the biggest impact on churn prediction.
- Behavior-based variables were more useful than basic demographics.
- K-Means clustering helped us spot interesting patterns, like high churn among short-term users.
- These insights can support more personalized retention tactics.

## About This Project

This was completed as part of my 2025 graduation thesis.  
It blends machine learning and customer analytics, aiming to show how data can support smarter business decisions.
